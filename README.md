# NOTE TAKE EXPRESS PROJECT

# Created an application through EXPRESS to create, save, and delete notes

- With this application, on Heroku, you'll be able to construct your note pad by creating, saving, and deleting notes.

# Problems
- Had issues with Heroku and actually had to build another repo to deploy the app.
- I accidently deleted the app on Heroku
- Here's a link to other github repo with more commits: https://github.com/Timih124/note-taker-express
- Creating a new repo I was easily able to reploy and connect with Heroku.
